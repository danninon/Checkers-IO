A few personal notes about the assignment:
first and foremost i would like to thank you for this opportunity, the assignment is interesting aswell.

things i would've done differently if i've had more time (theres a huge trade-off of time and functionality and thus, limitations with 5 hours of work):
on the server side:
1. I would split the gamelogic into classes such as board, unit, even creating an interface for a unit and implement a soldier for better modularity and readablity, would also add players.
2. would generate costume exceptions instead of using string comparisons
3. I would create an env file / files and would insert all kind of constants that are server related
4. definetly hadn't enough time, but would've added REST tests via postman or project file.
front side: 
1. I think its good, i just wanted to add the notifications via the socket and also would've added env files ofcourse, tests.

other notes:
1. i've been using visual studio to save running dotnet run and npm dev run every time (hadn't time to create a script to run them both, again, a time tradeoff)
2. i've used git as VC while writing this project, you can see the .git file.
3. i've used vite as a typescript react framework (it doesn't add functionality or anything)
4. i've used swagger on backend to test the controller and backend.
